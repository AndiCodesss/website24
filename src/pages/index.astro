			<h2><TextScramble text="About Me" delay="100" /></h2>
			<p>
				Hi there! I'm passionate about innovative ideas and automation that makes life easier.
				With a keen interest in quantitative finance, I love exploring where numbers meet strategy.
				I grew up in South Tyrol, a picturesque region in Northern Italy known for its stunning Alpine landscapes.
			</p>
			<p>
				What truly sets me apart is my talent for connecting with people. I excel in interpersonal communication and
				consider my social skills to be my greatest strength. I enjoy bringing people together and finding common ground
				in any situation.

				Andreas was debugging a particularly tricky piece of code late one night. Frustrated, he muttered, "Why won't this work? It's like talking to a brick wall!" Suddenly, his computer screen flickered, and text appeared: "Actually, brick walls are excellent listeners. They just have a terrible response time. And unlike this code, they rarely crash." Andreas stared, blinked, then slowly reached for the coffee pot. It was going to be a <em>very</em> long night.
