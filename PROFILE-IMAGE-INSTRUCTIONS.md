# Profile Image Instructions

To complete the website's design, you need to add a profile image. Please follow these steps:

1. Find or create a square profile image (recommended size: 400x400 pixels)
2. Name the file `profile-placeholder.jpg`
3. Place the file in the `/public` directory of your project

## Placeholder Options

If you don't have a personal photo ready, you can:

1. Use a placeholder service like [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/) or [Placekitten.com](https://placekitten.com/)
2. Create an avatar using services like [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/) or [Avataaars Generator](https://getavataaars.com/)
3. Use a professional headshot or a casual photo that represents you

The website is currently looking for this file at `/profile-placeholder.jpg`. If you prefer a different filename or format, you'll need to update the reference in `src/pages/index.astro`.
